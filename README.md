# TREEHOUSE PROJECT 5 - PUBLIC API REQUEST

https://rlertola.github.io/public_api_request-v1/

This project was made using html, css, and vanilla javascript.

### Random User API
12 random users are pulled in everytime the page is refreshed. Only english-speaking countries are used so that the search feature is possible. The data is processed and cards and modals are created. The cards are displayed and the modals are created and hidden.

### Modals
When each card is clicked, the modal for that employee is displayed. User can cycle through the modals with the previous and next buttons (exceeds). When the end or beginning of the list is reached, there are no errors, it will go back to the beginning or end of the list. Modals can be closed by clicking the 'x' in upper right.

### Search
As the user types (or deletes) in the search box, the cards are filtered and displayed dynamically.

### Updated Style
Background color has been changed from the original and some styling has been added, including box shadow on the cards, spacing between the modal buttons, button color, the closing 'x' style, and an underline for the header.
